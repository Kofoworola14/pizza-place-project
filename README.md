While checking through the maven analytics playground, the collation of the data sales for a particular pizza place restaurant for the year 2015 caught my attention, so I decided to analyze the data using Microsoft Excel.
I cleaned up the data in the power query editor and loaded the data back to Excel. 
The questions provided by the data served as a guide to help me create pivot tables and charts.
I was able to answer the questions and create five pivot charts from the data which I named; Order trend by day of the week, Order trend by month, Order trend by hour, Order trend by category and Customers order trend. So, basically I only created trends from the data.
I analyzed all the charts using a line chart and only analyzed order trend by category using a pie chart, as there were only four categories.
I created the slicers from the pivot charts to report connections between the slicers and the charts.
I then created a dashboard for my analysis by cutting each chart from the excel sheet and pasting on the dashboard and also doing the same with the slicers.
From the power pivot, I was able to calculate the peak hour of sales, the total orders made from the restaurant, the total sales made and the quantity of pizza made per order. 
I was also able to identify the category with the most order from the restaurant.
I then gave an insight on my analysis.
